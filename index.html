          <blockquote>&ldquo;On March 4, 2014, Gawker's tech-focused subsidiary Valleywag published &ldquo;Startup Flying Dateable Women to San Francisco Like It's Imperial Japan,&rdquo; stating, &ldquo;A startup called The Dating Ring has taken its inspiration from an unlikely source: the &lsquo;comfort women&rsquo; of World War II.&rdquo;</blockquote>

          <h3>Hacker News</h3>
          <p>Hacker News is notorious as an echo chamber for ignorant and divisive views. It is your humble maintainer's opinion that there are far better news sources out there.</p>

      <h2>how to block</h2>
      <p>This command appends list.txt to your /etc/hosts file. To prevent you from seeing them.</p>
      <code>
        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llkats/the-list/master/list.txt >> /etc/hosts
      </code>
      <p>The flags are there to handle error cases more gracefully and safely handle redirects. See man curl for a more comprehensive explanation.</p>
